  - Cons:
    - Limited feature incorporation
    - May not capture complex item-store interactions

- **SARIMA/SARIMAX**
  - Pros:
    - Explicitly models seasonality
    - Well-established for time series
  - Cons:
    - Single series at a time
    - Assumes stationarity
    - Limited with external features

### 1.2 Tree-based Models
- **LightGBM**
  - Pros:
    - Handles categorical features well
    - Fast training and prediction
    - Good with large datasets
    - Can capture non-linear relationships

    - Robust to outliers
    - Handles missing values well
    - Good feature importance
  - Cons:
    - Memory intensive
    - Slower than LightGBM

- **CatBoost**
  - Pros:
    - Handles categorical features automatically
    - Good with temporal data
    - Less prone to overfitting
  - Cons:
    - Slower training than LightGBM
    - Memory intensive

### 1.3 Linear Models
- **ElasticNet**
  - Pros:
    - Interpretable
    - Good with sparse features
    - Handles multicollinearity
  - Cons:
    - May miss non-linear patterns
    - Limited with temporal aspects

### 1.4 Deep Learning
- **LSTM/GRU Networks**
  - Pros:
    - Can capture long-term dependencies
    - Good with sequential data
  - Cons:
    - Requires large data
    - Long training time
    - Complex to tune

## 2. Model Selection Strategy

### 2.1 Primary Model Selection
Based on the data characteristics and problem requirements:

1. **LightGBM as Primary Model**
   - Reasons:
     - Can handle both categorical and numerical features
     - Fast training allows quick iteration
     - Good with time-based features
     - Handles missing values well
     - Can capture store-item interactions
     - Proven track record in retail forecasting

2. **XGBoost as Secondary Model**
   - For ensemble diversity
   - Different handling of missing values
   - Potentially better with outliers

### 2.2 Complementary Models
- **Prophet**
  - Use for baseline predictions
  - Capture overall trends and seasonality
  - Features can be used in tree models

### 2.3 Ensemble Strategy
1. Level 1: Individual Models
   - LightGBM with different parameters
   - XGBoost
   - Prophet baseline
   
2. Level 2: Meta-Model
   - LightGBM/Linear stacking
   - Weighted average with validation performance

## 3. Model Validation Strategy

### 3.1 Metrics to Monitor
- Primary: RMSE (competition metric)
- Secondary:
  - MAE
  - MAPE
  - R-squared

### 3.2 Cross-Validation
- Time-based rolling validation
- Multiple validation periods
- Match test set timeframe

### 3.3 Model Specific Considerations
- Monitor training time
- Memory usage
- Prediction time
- Feature importance stability

## 4. Implementation Plan

1. Start with baseline models:
   - Simple moving averages
   - Prophet for trend/seasonality

2. Implement tree-based models:
   - LightGBM with basic features
   - Add feature groups incrementally
   - Track improvement per feature group

3. Add complementary models:
   - XGBoost with best features
   - Specialized models for specific patterns

4. Develop ensemble:
   - Test different combining strategies
   - Optimize weights using validation data

## 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Track model drift
- Monitor feature importance
- Validate predictions against business logic
- Regular retraining schedule
- Performance monitoring by store/category
